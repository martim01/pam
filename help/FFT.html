<h1>Introduction</h1><p>&nbsp;<img alt="fft_main" src="images/2818_main.JPG" height="240" width="406" border="0" /></p><p>The FFT plugin shows the frequency spectrum of the audio. The plugin performs a Fast Fourier transform of each incoming chunk of audio and displays the the result in a graph where the x-axis shows the frequency components of the audio and the y-axis the amplitude of each frequency in dBFS. At the bottom of the screen the labels with the blue background show in order:</p><ul><li>The display options</li><ul><li>Graph</li><li>Lines</li><li>EQ</li></ul><li>The calcuation type</li><ul><li>FFT</li><li>1/3 Octave</li><li>Peak</li></ul><li>The audio routing</li><li>The FFT windowing function</li><li>The FFT overlap between audio chunks</li><li>The resolution of the FFT</li><li>The dominant frequency (the frequency with greatest amplitude)</li><li>The amplitude of the dominant frequency.</li></ul><h1>Options</h1><h2>Routing</h2><p><img alt="fft_routing" src="images/2818_routing.JPG" height="240" width="401" border="0" /></p><p>The plugin shows the FFT for a single channel of audio. The Routing options page allows you to select which channel you wish to analyse.</p><p>In stereo mode the user is also allowed to select</p><ul><li>Middle (L+R)</li><li>Side (L-R)</li></ul><p>The 3rd blue label shows the current routing.</p><h2>Display</h2><p><img alt="fft_display" src="images/2818_display.JPG" height="240" width="402" border="0" /></p><p>The display page allows the user to change they way the FFT is plotted.</p><ul><li>Graph - shows a continuous line from the lowest to highest frequency</li><li>Lines - shows individual lines for each frequency</li><li>EQ - shows purple non overlapping &quot;EQ&quot; bars.</li></ul>The 1st blue label shows the current display mode.<br /><h2>Window</h2><p><img alt="fft_window" src="images/2818_window.JPG" height="240" width="398" border="0" /></p><p>When performing spectrum analysis of live audio the incoming audio must be split in to chunks of data and each individually analysised. This can cause &quot;spectral leakage&quot;. Therefore a windowing function is usually applied to the chunks of audio to smooth the edges of each window. There are a number of different windowing functions available, all of which give slightly different characteristics to the resultant frequency response. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function">here </a> for more information.</p><p>The 4th blue label shows the current windowing function.</p><h2>Type</h2><p><img alt="fft_type" src="images/2818_type.JPG" height="240" width="400" border="0" /></p><p>There are currently three possible types of spectrum analysis that can be performed:</p><ul><li>FFT - performs a fast fourier transform on the incoming audio and displays the resultant frequency/amplitude bins.</li><li>1/3 Octave - performs a fast fourier transform on the incoming audio and then calculates the energy in 1/3 octave bands.</li><li>Peaks - performs a fast fourier transform and then calculates the &quot;peaks&quot;. This is done by looking at each frequency bin and only displaying those where the bin on either side is lower.</li></ul>The 2nd blue label shows the type.<br /><h2>Overlap</h2><p><img alt="fft_overlap" src="images/2818_overla.JPG" height="240" width="397" border="0" /></p><p>Another way of making the spectrum analysis more accurate when dealing with chunks of live audio is by overlapping each chunk of audio. This page allows the user to decide how much he wants this overlap to be.</p><p>The 5th blue label shows the amount of overlap.</p><h2>Bins</h2><p><img alt="fft_bins" src="images/2818_bins.JPG" height="240" width="403" border="0" /></p><p>When performing an FFT on audio the result is split in to a number of &quot;bins&quot; each a certain frequency wide. The more bins that you use the narrower each bin and hence the better the frequency resolution. However more bins means that you need to read in more audio before you can perform the FFT and so the refresh rate is slower. This page allows the user to choose the frequency resolution he wants.</p><p>The 6th blue label shows the current resolution.</p><h2>Options</h2><p><img alt="fft_options" src="images/2818_options.JPG" height="240" width="400" border="0" /></p><p>From this page the user can freeze the display by pressing the Hold button and enter &quot;Cursor Mode&quot; by pressing the Cursor Mode button</p><h3>Cursor Mode</h3><p><img alt="fft_cursor" src="images/2818_cursor_mode.JPG" height="240" width="401" border="0" /></p><p>When the user presses the Cursor Mode button the plugin will go full screen again and look as above. This allows the user to see the amplitude of different frequencies of the audio.<br /></p><p>There is a red dotted line that shows the currently selected frequency. The grey label at the top shows the value of this frequency and the - and + buttons allow the user to change this frequency. The user can also change this frequency by touching the screen.</p><p>The label 2nd from right shows the amplitude of the selected frequency.</p><p>Pressing the &quot;Exit&quot; button will exit from Cursor Mode.<br /></p>
