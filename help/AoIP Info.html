<h1>Introduction</h1><p><img alt="main" src="images/2824_main.JPG" height="240" width="404" border="0" /></p><p>The AoIP plugin shows information about any connected Audio Over IP session rather than the actual audio. Note if the selected input is Soundcard or File rather than RTP then this plugin will show some information about the selected input.</p><p>The plugin does not go full screen so the <strong><span style="color: #33cccc">Screen Selection </span></strong>and <strong><span style="color: #33ccff">Option Selection</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #33cccc" /></strong> buttons <strong><span style="color: #33ccff" /></strong>are always visible.<br /></p><p>The plugin has 4 pages of information selectable by clicking on the Tabs at the top of the screen.</p><h2>Session</h2><p> Shows the overall Session details.</p><ul><li>Input - the name of the connection as defined/discovered in the main AoIP Settings page. This will be empty if the input is not set to RTP<br /></li><li>Name - <br /></li><ul><li>If the input is RTP this will show the name of the sesson as defined in the SDP</li><li>If the input is Soundcard this will show the selected soundcard input</li><li>If the input is File this will show the filename<br /></li></ul><li>Type - the type of connection. <br /></li><ul><li>If the input is RTP this will show either Mulitcast or Unicast.</li><li>If the input is Soundcard this will say Soundcard</li><li>If the input is File this will say File<br /></li></ul><li>Description - any desciption for the session as defined in the SDP</li><li>Sync Type/Version/ID/Domain - Synchronization details</li><li>Audio Subsessions - the number of audio subsessions that this Session contains</li><li>Video Subsessions - the number of vide subsession this Session contains</li><li>Duplicate Streams - SMPTE 2110 allows duplicate audio and video streams in a single session. <br /></li></ul><h2>Active Subsession</h2><p><img alt="subsession" src="images/2824_subsession.JPG" height="240" width="400" border="0" /></p><p>Shows information about the currently connected Subsession</p><ul><li>Source</li><ul><li>If the input is RTP this will show the IP address of the incoming audio. This may be a Unicast or Multicast address</li><li>If the input is Soundcard this will show the selected soundcard input.</li><li>If the input is File this will show the filename</li></ul><li>Codec - this will show the RTP audio codec. PAM can currently decode L24 (PCM 24 bit) and L16 (PCM 16 bit).</li><li>Frequency - this is the sample rate of the incoming audio</li><li>Channels - this is the number of channels in the incoming audio. PAM can currently cope with 0-8 channels.</li><li>Id - this is the RTP id of the active subsession</li><li>Sync Type/Version/Sync ID/Domain - Synchronization details.</li><li>Sync Timestamp - all RTP frames have a 32 bit count in the header. The sync timestamp is the timestamp that the RTP frame count would be 0.</li><li>Current Timestamp - this is the timestamp of the incoming RTP header.</li><li>Transmission Time - this is the time that the incoming RTP header was transmitted from the sender.</li><li>Presentation Time - this is the time that the incoming RTP header was received by PAM</li><li>Network Latency - this is the difference between the Presentation Time and the Transmission Time.</li><li>Display/Playback Time - this is the time that the audio was displayed on the screen and (if enabled) played out.</li><li>Playback latency - this is the difference between the Display/Playback Time and the Presentation Time.</li><li>Last Frame Size - this is the number of bytes received in the last RTP frame</li><li>Last Frame Duration - this is the amount of audio (in time) received in the last RTP frame.</li></ul><h2>QoS</h2><p><img alt="qos" src="images/2824_qos.JPG" height="240" width="399" border="0" /></p><p>Shows information about the quality of the incoming RTP stream. The QoS measurements are taken at preset intervals. The user can change the interval by selecting the Settings option page (see below).</p><ul><li>QoS Measurement Time - shows how long the QoS measurements have been running</li><li>Total Packets Received - shows the total number of RTP packets received.</li><li>Total Packets Lost - shows the total number of RTP packets lost.</li><li>kBits/s Min - shows the minimum bitrate of the incoming RTP stream.</li><li>kBits/s Average - shows the average bitrate of the incoming RTP stream.</li><li>kBits/s Max - shows the maximum bitrate of the incoming RTP stream.</li><li>Packets Lost/s Min - show the mnimum number of packets lost per second.</li><li>Packets Lost/s Average - shows the average nunmber of packets lost per second.</li><li>Packet Lost/s Max - show the maximum number of packets lost per second.</li><li>Inter Packet Gap Min - shows the minumum amount of time between two adjacent packets being received.</li><li>Inter Packet Gap Average - shows the average amount of time between two adjacent packets being received.</li><li>Inter Packet Gap Max - shows the maximum amount of time between two adjacent packets being received.</li><li>Jitter - shows the current variation in packet delay in ms.</li><li>Current Graph - shows what the graph below is currently showing</li></ul><p>Below the labels is a graph showing a history of the selected QoS measurement.</p><ul><li>The graph moves from right to left. So the right of the graph is current time and the further to the left the further back in time.</li><li>The labels on the left of the graph show the maximum and minimum values of the selected QoS measurement. <br /></li><li>The coloured line on the graph shows the moment by moment value and the white line (if shown) shows the average value.</li></ul><h2>Raw SDP</h2><p><img alt="sdp" src="images/2824_sdp.JPG" height="240" width="398" border="0" /> <br /></p><p>Shows the raw SDP description for the session as received by PAM. <br /></p>
